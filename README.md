## Publications

**Assessment and Mitigation of Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models within the Domain of Remote Sensing (Under Review)**

**Zihui Zhou**, Yong Feng, Guofan Duan, Mingliang Zhou, and Weijia Jia

- We characterize MLLM hallucination patterns in the remote sensing field, establishing a taxonomy that categorizes 4 different hallucination types.
- We propose an MLLM hallucinations detection suite: including **the RSHalluEval benchmark, evaluation metrics, and flexible automated hallucination detection strategies (for precision-focused and efficiency-focused scenes, respectively)**, and evaluate MLLM hallucinations in this domain.
- We introduce **RSHalluShield**: a hallucination mitigation dataset of 30,000 QA pairs.
- We fine-tune the model on the RSHalluShield dataset, resulting in a 12.33% increase in the hallucination-free rate. Superior performance is also achieved on downstream tasks.

**Fine-Grained Information Supplementation and Value-Guided Learning for Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval**

**Zihui Zhou**, Yong Feng, Agen Qiu, Guofan Duan, and Mingliang Zhou

**accepted by the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing** | [**Paper**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10716520) | [**Code**](https://github.com/zhouzihui2001/FISVL/tree/main)

We propose a fine-grained information supplementation and value-guided learning (FISVL) model. Feature enhancement is carried out by integrating the prior knowledge in the field of recommendation systems, and a value-oriented training strategy is adopted to learn feature representations that are fine-grained, highly expressive and robust. Specifically, FISVL contains the following core modules:
1. ‚Äã**fine-grained information supplementation (FGIS)‚Äã**: By fusing the visual information of global and local features, the perception ability of the model for multi-scale features of remote sensing images is enhanced, and the problem of representation limitations caused by insufficient feature granularity in traditional methods is solved.
2. ‚Äã**Double loss optimization mechanism**: Aiming at the problem of excessive similarity within the mode, weighted contrast loss (the weighting strategy refers to the dynamic adjustment method of sample importance) and scene adaptive fine-grained perceptial loss are proposed to improve the model discrimination ability by constraining the spatial distribution of features.
3. ‚Äã**Value-Guided Learning Framework**: enables the model to focus on the most valuable information at different training stages, thereby adapting to the specific requirements of each phase.
We verify the validity of the model on the RSICD and RSITMD datasets. The results show that this method reaches the leading level in both fine-grained feature learning and cross-modal alignment tasks.
